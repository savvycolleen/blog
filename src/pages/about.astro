	<h2>What's With the Blog Name?</h2>
	<p>I have crocheted on again, off again for most of my life. A few years ago, I thought it would be fun to create a public account to show what I was working on & learning. I went with one of my nicknames + what I was doing (yarn ðŸ˜…), and my first public profile was born: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/savvydoesyarn/"><em>savvydoesyarn</em></a></p>
	<p>Once I started my tech journey and needed to create new social accounts, I stuck with the pattern and became <em>savvydoestech</em>. So while the account you'll see linked here are my tech accounts, I went for a more generalized blog name. Thank you for reading more info on that than you probably ever wanted to know.</p>
	<h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
	<p>I've found that anytime I am trying something new (...which is often--<em>thank you, ADHD!</em>), I get deep in the trenches with finding resources, getting stuck, problem-solving, and getting unstuck over and over again. As I constantly benefit from people who put themselves out there to share their knowledge and even their failures, I am here to do the same.</p>
	<p>So here, you can expect to see: transparency, successes, failures, learning/building in public, lessons learned, and resources used.</p>
	<h2>Let's Be Friends</h2>
	<p>In case you didn't believe when mentioned above that I love making friends, I'm iterating it here: be my friend! Connect with me and tell me who you are and what you are learning, too. Everything in life is better done together!</p>
